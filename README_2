NOTE: Lab 3 is incomplete, so it is not possible to compare actual data from the source code. However, the following paragraphs will explain what should have happened if the Lab was working properly. There will also be some background information on memory allocation algorithms.

In the first fit algorithm, the SLOB allocator had a much greater amount of memory free than memory claimed. Therefore, there is a high degree of fragmentation.

In the best-fit algorithm, the SLOB allocator still had more free memory than claimed memory but at a lower degree of fragmentation than the first fit algorithm. 

Overall, using the best-fit alogrithm in the system reduced fragmentation at a greater rate when compared with using the first fit algorithm. Also, in terms of speed, best fit runs slower than first fit because the algorithm must search entire pages more often than the first fit algorithm.
